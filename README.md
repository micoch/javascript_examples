# javascript_examples

I have created this repo to help me collect useful and interesting plugins and scripts to help remind me of the tools I want to use in my personal projects while keeping them centralized so that I can always find them.  Some of the scripts serve to help me remeber the basic how-to(s) for accomplishing simple and routine tasks with javascript, and others are kept here for quick reference for things I might lose touch with.  If anyone finds these things helpful great but if anyone knows of something that could be useful feel free to create a pull request and add to it, just be sure to provide links to documentation as well as a quick description in this readme.

### [NiceScroll](http://github.com/inuyaksa/jquey.nicescroll) by inuyaksa

This is a nice plugin that subtley styles the scroll bar in a way that keeps the focus on the project/design as it was intended to be.  It is easy to implement for basic useage as you can derive from the example.js file.  Visit inuyaksa's repo for more documentation.
