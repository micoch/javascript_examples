I have created this repo to help collect useful and interesting plugins and scripts to help remind me of the tools I want to use in my personal projects.

### [NiceScroll](http://github.com/inuyaksa/jquey.nicescroll) by inuyaksa

This is a nice plugin that subtley styles the scroll bar in a way that keeps the focus on the project/design as it was intended to be.  It is easy to implement for basic useage as you can derive from the example.js file.  Visit inuyaksa's repo for more documentation.
